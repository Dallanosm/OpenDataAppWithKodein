# CÃ¡ceres Monuments App

In this project, I use some new tecnologies to get info about monuments from http://opendata.caceres.es/. The project is defined in three layers: presentation, domain and data. It's development in Kotlin!

 * Presentation
 	* MVP Pattern.
 	* Kodein for Dependency Injection.
 	* Extensions functions (Kotlin feature)
 	
 * Domain
 	* RxJava 2
 
 * Data
	* Retrofit 2
	* Repository pattern
	* JsonToKotlin plugin


Maybe, this is not the best example that you can see about clean architecture and good practices in Android. But I try to learn to use new tecnologies as Kotlin, RxJava 2, etc. If you see some mistakes in my implementation, contact with me please :)

I use the domain layer idea from https://github.com/Petrulak. I think that the defined solution is interesting.
